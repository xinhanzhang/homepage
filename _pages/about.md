I am a postdoctoral fellow at IGIER, Bocconi.

I am a theorist with focus in decision theory and information economics. I am motivated in understanding the process of how economic agents perceive risk, uncertainty and information, update beliefs, and make corresponding economic decisions. 

Prior to joining IGIER, I obtained my PhD at the Department of Economics, National University of Singapore (NUS), and my bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and double degree in economics from Tsinghua University. Here is my [CV](https://xinhanzhang.github.io/homepage/files/CV Nov24L).

Working Papers
======
**1. Consistency and Pairwise Consistency** (with Yi-Chun Chen)

   We study the finite Harsanyi model where each agent's type is associated with a posterior belief over some fundamental uncertainty and type profiles of other agents. We show that if the agents' posteriors have full support, the model admits a common prior (i.e., is consistent in Harsanyi's sense) if and only if any pair of agents have a common prior. We extend the result to Aumann models where posteriors need not have full support but satisfy a condition called _double irreducibility_ which strengthens the irreducibility condition of Samet (1998). Our results imply circumstances where characterizations of consistency such as the no-trade theorems and the convergence of higher-order expectations reduce to the corresponding characterizations for pairwise consistency.
   
**2. Correlation Preference** (with Yi-Chun Chen, Soo Hong Chew)

   Correlatedness between lotteries arising from social situations is ubiquitous. We propose a general utility representation for binary choice between
pairs of possibly correlated lotteries rather than adopt the common practice of treating them as being independent. We axiomatize two classes of preference
corresponding respectively to the correlation counterparts of the independence axiom for EU and to two axioms in non-EU characterizing weighted
utility: betweenness and projective independence. The resulting correlation expected utility and correlation weighted utility can be discriminated using
recent evidence of correlation-sensitive Allais behavior which supports the latter model rather than the former.

**3. Age Discrimination in Hiring: Evidence from Online Job Ads** (with Qinyue Luo, Liaoliang Zhang)

   We analyze explicit age discrimination decisions by employers and job seekers’ responses to them in the Chinese labor market, based on a large-scale
national job ads dataset of more than 7.6 million job postings from November 2018 to April 2019, with 48% postings specifically excluding certain age groups.
Discrimination decisions vary significantly across firm types, sizes, industries, and occupations. Factors such as expected processing costs, competition in labor
demand, job skill requirements, and ageist languages play a crucial role in discrimination decisions, highlighting both search-related concerns and tastebased
discrimination. These results are consistent with a labor demand model where employers decide whether to consider (undesired) candidates from an additional
age group based on their search factors and preferences. Additionally, we offer a labor supply model where applicants consider firms’ age requirements
as signals rather than hard rules. We find that job seekers indeed do not fully comply with firms’ explicit age preferences and non-compliance is higher for job
postings with more skill requirements. Nonetheless, the use of age discrimination tends to attract younger workers while negatively correlated with skilled
applicants.
