I am a PhD student at the Department of Economics, National University of Singapore.

I am interested in the micro-economics when there is a lack of information. I work on decision making under risk/uncertainty, incomplete information game theory, and the more applied information design problems.

Prior to joining NUS, I obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics, and double degree in economics from Tsinghua University. Here is my CV (https://github.com/xinhanzhang/files/CV1023.pdf).

1. Consistency and Pairwise Consistency (link)

   Abstractï¼š

   We study the finite Harsanyi model where each agent's type is associated with a posterior belief over some fundamental uncertainty and type profiles of other agents. We show that if the agents' posteriors have full support, the model admits a common prior (i.e., is consistent in Harsanyi's sense) if and only if any pair of agents have a common prior. We extend the result to Aumann models where posteriors need not have full support but satisfy a condition called _double irreducibility_ which strengthens the irreducibility condition of Samet (1998). Our results imply circumstances where characterizations of consistency such as the no-trade theorems and the convergence of higher-order expectations reduce to the corresponding characterizations for pairwise consistency.
   
1. Correlated Utility Theory -  An Optimal Transport Approach (link)

   Abstract:

   We provide a unifying perspective on two seemingly unrelated strands of the literature: decision-making under risk and the modern theory of optimal transport originated in Kantorovich (1939). This is accomplished by axiomatically generalizing the classical theory of nontransitive binary choice, called correlated expected utility, a la Fishburn (1982) and Lanzani (2022) which satisfies skew symmetry and provides a shared foundation to regret theory (Bell, 1982; Loomes and Sugden, 1982, 1987) and salience theory (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2012). For pairs of correlated lotteries by axiomatizing a general
correlation-sensitive representation including the skew-symmetric model of Lanzani (2022)) which in turn Beyond skew symmetry, our approach includes as special case the expectations-based reference dependent utility model of Koszegi and Rabin (2007) applied to binary choice. By applying the Kantorovich duality to the primal problem based on the correlation-sensitive representation, we obtain a dual problem that reduces to an expected utility representation when the decision maker is insensitive to correlation.
