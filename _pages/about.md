I am a postdoctoral fellow at IGIER, Bocconi.

I am interested in the micro-economics when there is a lack of information. I work on decision making under risk/uncertainty and incomplete information game theory.

Prior to joining IGIER, I obtained my PhD at the Department of Economics, National University of Singapore, my bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and double degree in economics from Tsinghua University. Here is my [CV](https://xinhanzhang.github.io/homepage/files/CV1023.pdf).

Working Papers
======
**1. Consistency and Pairwise Consistency** (with Yi-Chun Chen)

   We study the finite Harsanyi model where each agent's type is associated with a posterior belief over some fundamental uncertainty and type profiles of other agents. We show that if the agents' posteriors have full support, the model admits a common prior (i.e., is consistent in Harsanyi's sense) if and only if any pair of agents have a common prior. We extend the result to Aumann models where posteriors need not have full support but satisfy a condition called _double irreducibility_ which strengthens the irreducibility condition of Samet (1998). Our results imply circumstances where characterizations of consistency such as the no-trade theorems and the convergence of higher-order expectations reduce to the corresponding characterizations for pairwise consistency.
   
**2. Correlation Preference** (with Yi-Chun Chen, Soo Hong Chew)

   We propose a correlation utility (CU) representation of correlation preference without requiring transitivity nor completeness. Under a correlation independence axiom, CU specializes to correlation expected utility (CEU) which is not compatible with the extended Allais paradox. This motivates our correlation betweenness and correlation projective independence axioms, which characterize correlation weighted utility (CWU). In the absence of correlation
sensitivity, CEU reduces to EU while CWU reduces to skew-symmetric bilinear utility which reduces further to weighted utility under transitivity. Finally, we characterize correlation probabilistic sophistication, subsuming two major directions of generalization of SEU: maintaining Savageâ€™s Postulate 2 without transitivity, and vice versa.
